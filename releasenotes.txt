### Release notes
* v0.0.6    26.01.2022  workflow seems to be working, no telemetry support yet
* v0.0.7    28.02.2022  adding global variable telemetry, making TECS globally available for tecstm.lua
* v0.0.8    01.03.2022	correcting TECS_PITCH_MAX
* v0.0.9    01.03.2022	added 4 deg margin to TECS_PITCH_MIN and TECS_PITCH_MAX
* v0.1.0    01.03.2022	changed procedure for ARSPD_FBW_MIN from circle to straight without a security margin
* v0.1.1    02.03.2022	logfiles will be written with timestamp
* v0.1.2    02.03.2022	setting default to 0 for TECS_PITCH_MAX&TECS_PITCH_MIN
* v0.1.3    03.03.2022	adding post-step-status sounds
* v0.1.4    03.03.2022	correcting hSpeed to airspeed as telemetry source
* v0.2.0    06.03.2022  airspeed will be read from telemetry.hSpeed again, more unit convertion (dm/s to kph and m/s), logging timestamp updated, adding debug option to log raw values
* v0.2.1    07.03.2022  with FRSKY_OPTIONS=1 we will get airspeed and groundspeed consistant since customV10.
                        FRSKY_OPTIONS=0 will override groundspeed with airspeed and not send airspeed as a separate telemetry field.
                        now we support both, using groundspeed/hSpeed unless airspeed is supplied.
